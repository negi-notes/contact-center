Personally I didnt want to go. Now, we all know that Feb3 is the superbowl. I told my wife I was cool with coming home Feb3. I am a NY Giants fan and no one out there including myself(die hard fan) didnt think that the Giant would ever make it to the superbowl. OK, we are flying back Feb3 not too bad right? WRONG!!! Our flight is during the game. AHHH! So i decide to try to change the flight to earlier time. Well, online they wanted to charge me $300 to change my flight to leave 3 hours earlier. So I figured that I will call them and maybe they can reason with me. Well, I called and waited 30 minutes to talk to someone and they told me the same thing $300. I told them it was highway robbery. I can understand why for changing times. I t makes more sense to penalize you if you canceled or if you changed carriers, but not for changeing times. I dont think its right. There are many companies to choose from and I choose them. You would think a little help would be nice from them. What if there was an emergency at home? What are they going to charge me $300 for that too. Sorry, but I'm just frustrated and I dont think it is fair for paying customers to pay a penalty to changes the times of their flight. Back to the Superbowl issue... I am planning to do standby in case we get lucky. I will also record the game so I can watch it when I get home that night. I will have to not listen to the radio or look at an TVs before getting home. So therefore NWA is not cool and I wil not choose them again.

I have posted my Mothers email below so you are able to see what they experienced. Firstly though the check in was terrible, rude and condescening and had to deal with 3 different people all with a different take. The series of events below are not all personally BA's fault but their obvious lack of management of people paying to travel on their service is unbelievable. My Father has also flown on BA from Auckland to London via Asia and had his own experiences where his seat would not stay up and was told off by a flight attendant for not putting it up for landing and when he told them about it they did nothing - it is actually illegal for them to have a passenger seated in a seat that does not stay up for landing and take off but they did nothing, when he got back on the plane after the transit they still had not done anything and he still had to sit in that seat????? Personally I am a member of Star Alliance and flew over 70,000 miles last year to various places around the globe and didn't experience anything like this...... Extract from my Mothers email: Yes we did make it home but it was the flight from hell!!. Of course ready to go and they cancelled due to plane being hit by lightening. Found another plane and announced at 6.00 that it was ready. Everyone lined up at the gate then my name was called out to go to the front. Took my bag and pull on with me but discovered Kuku had my cell phone in his bag. it ended up I had been random selected to have a full search along with about 20 others. Once this was done they loaded me with the others selected onto a bus, closed the doors and left us siting out on the tarmac for another hour. Noone came near the bus to communicate what was happening and of course unable to contact Kuku to let him know. Finally bused to the plane and took of about 7.30. 3.5 hours late. 'The nightmare really began when we got to LA. Had to line up to go through the Visa section told the guy we had a connecting flight and he said we had heaps of time to just stay where we were. Collected our bags finally to find we had to go through customs with the line a mile long. Explained again our flight was nearly due to go and they said ""just stay in the line"".(not even a transit line) When we finally got through there was no one or any signs to tell us where to go but found someone who said terminal 4 which was outside and a few down. Went through another check where a guy said with a smile your'e going to miss the plane. Raced forward and in the final check an official said ""take your cabin bags and leave your bags with me and run"". Raced down the terminal as they were calling Kuku's and my name and arrived at the gate as they guy was signing off and saying we had not arrived. Said into the phone ""they are here... change that"". We got on as they were saying doors were closed and we were ready to go. The flight was great but of course when we arrived in Auckland no bags and when enquired the lady seemed surprised that they had not sent word that the bags were following. We were going to go and check on Zazu but after the experience felt cold, tired and exhausted and came straight home. I have been checking with Air NZ baggage who manage lost bags and the status is still ""tracing"". However, I have checked incoming flights from LA and the next Qantas flight was to land 8.15 this morning (seems to be 1 a day). So I will check back then and see if it turns up.

1,1,2055,"Fear of flying is something many travelers -- or would-be travelers -- have to deal with. Statistically air travel is quite safe. And fear of flying can be overcome easily. Fear of flying can exhibit itself in a wide range of feelings depending on the individual -- everything from being simply uneasy about getting on an airplane to a serious, crippling phobia of air travel. It is also sometimes referred to as aviatophobia, aviophobia, or pteromerhanophobia. Commercial flight has become an important, even essential, part of modern life; yet flying continues to cause a significant proportion of the public to feel anxiety. Fear of flying seems to contradict the facts; for example, driving in an automobile is statistically many times more dangerous. Frankly, I find I have a much greater fear of taxi drivers with an obvious ""death wish"" careening recklessly through heavy traffic on the way to an airport, than I do of any air trip I'm about to undertake. Does the thought of flying make you feel a little shaky? Or is your reaction more extreme -- you feel panicky and frequently find ways to avoid airplane trips? The fear of flying is common with a range of severities. There are many treatment programs available, some even run by airlines. Whether you fear a crash or hate being confined to a crowded plane, there is hope. A Google search for 'fear of flying' brings up a huge number of interesting websites: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGIH,GGIH:2007-02,GGIH:en&q=fear+of+flying I've never myself experienced any real fear of air travel and I've traveled extensively. But I've known many people with varying degrees of it. Over quite a few years of traveling to many places I've even had the scary misfortune of finding myself in a couple of ""emergency landing"" scenarios which happily resulted in no serious mishap. . But thinking back on those I realize they never gave me a fear of air travel after the fact.

1,1,1648,"On March 12th SAS sent our checked in (in Birmingham) luggage on the flight after ours from Copenhagen to Oslo-no explanation, no apology, but it did at least eventually arrive.And they knew where it was. As we were staying at an airport hotel it was no big deal and we shrugged it off-we travel a lot and this has never happened to either of us before. We got back to Birmingham last night-one of our (2) checked- in bags did not. They don't know where it is , which I find slightly worrying,not least because airlines are supposedly so hot on security. I realise it won't be classed as 'lost' until after 21 days . And as we are now home this may seem relatively unimportant and I appreciate it could be worse. But the said bag contains all our thermal underwear, a fleece( all especially purchased for the holiday) and 8 heavy- duty cotton shirts belonging to my husband, as well as thick sweaters, trousers etc . Given the present freezing weather in the UK, we could do with these items . Would I be justified in asking the airline for fairly immediate partial compensation ? Even if it does eventually turn up-and there have been two flights from Copenhagen today so I'm not hopeful- am I entitled to some redress for the delay in such circumstances? We do have good travel insurance, with only a £35 excess, which would compensate us to the full value (approximately £1500 including the case itself, which is new and expensive). Should I just forget the airline and go straight to them? Out of curiosity does anyone know what happens if they compensate you and the case turns up? There are a couple of items which have some sentimental, if not monetary, value which I cannot replace and would really like back (a mirrored compact and an engraved hip flask containing whiskey, neither of which I could put in my hand luggage-I'm just glad our walking boots were in there) I would add that the said case while large and black does have a bright pink strap around it with our name on it, plus address labels inside and out...

My luggage missed the connection at Madrid and I am now trying to claim compensation. BA say it is not their problem as the flight was operated by Iberia and that I should complain to them. I had understood that EU legislation and even UK legislation existed to make the Marketing airline equally liable for such matters. Can you please advise me on this? Secondly – I followed EXACTLY what both BA and the local agent (Iberia) in Santo Domingo told me to do including to travel to the airport in SD to pick up my delayed luggage when it finally arrived and BA are also telling me that they wont reimburse the taxi fare incurred despite my taking the taxi at Iberia’s instruction. They now say that I should have just waited and purchased any necessary items for which they would have reimbursed me. Iberia told me to pick the bags up as 1) They had failed to deliver them at the time they promised, 2) I was leaving the hotel then and touring with no fixed location for some 6 weeks and therefore there was no other possibility to reunite me with my baggage, 3) my baggage contained many items including essential prescription medication which was unobtainable in the Dominican Republic and without which I would have had to fly home early and therefore would have had a much more substantial claim against the airline and so under my obligation to “mitigate the airlines loss” I traveled to the airport (which was also what they told me to do) to pick up my bags in person.

Next month I'm travelling again, but this time alone, and I have a few questions if some of you lovely people can take the time to answer them for me? My first question, in May I travelled with Ryanair, they were very specific that the information I entered on the system matched exactly, especially my passport number. This time I'm travelling with KLM, and although I've filled in my advanced traveller information, they haven't asked for my passport number at all. Is this normal? Second question. I'm taking a connecting flight in Amsterdam, my first time doing this too! When I disembark from the first flight, I don't have to pass through security? I'm assuming that for flight connections there will be sign posts, and you go to a different part of the airport? And lastly, checking in. On the way out I will print out my boarding pass, and I'm not taking hold luggage. So, does this mean once I pass through security I can just wait for my flight to board? Or do I have to do something else? And another (ok, it wasn't the last question!), on the return leg I think will try the mobile boarding pass.

I plan to buy a Delta Sky Club day pass and have a shower, but obviously would skip the shower if not enough time. - Hate to sound like a stereotypical Australian, but - VEGEMITE.

TSA website and USFS website assure me skates can go in carry-on for US domestic, and I have the printout. Should I expect delays at security with my skates in my carry-on? - Delta's website says that check-in closes 45 minutes before the flight except at certain airports. I can't find COS on that list - will I be okay arriving at COS airport at 0530 for a 0630 flight? - Finally, on the way out, how long should I allow for outbound security, immigration etc at LAX?

The following morning when the agent replied, I got the textbook response of the airline's fee for a name change. I responded that this wasn't a ""name change"", it was a name correction. Flight Centre are adamant that my electronically signed invoice confirms I checked all names before ticketing. I have a couple of issues with this: 1. My mum's name was not on the invoice. Just my Aunt's name. (I think this is most important). 2. The time stamp of my electronic signature is AFTER the creation of the booking. 3.

1,1,2294,"This is more of a hypothetical enquiry, as I am not planning to fly in the near future (unfortunately!), but I am wondering and figured you experts would be able to shed some light on this. I can see the advantages of OLCI, especially when flying without checked baggage, and/or when flying with a LCC who charges for printing boarding passes at the airport. However, I for some reason feel rather ""insecure"" when thinking about OLCI. I've always viewed checking in as a way for the airline to know you are at the airport, which can be useful information, no? While they won't hold the flight for you, I'm thinking of the airlines calling the names of people who are late for the flight, you know ""Mr. Smith, please go to gate XX for boarding"", etc. So if you've done OLCI (and didn't have any luggage to check), the airline wouldn't know that you are in the airport, and could be wasting their time/breath calling you? Not that this has any significance in the long run, just wondering. Also, I'm thinking back on a previous flying experience, when I checked-in at the airport, and wondering what would've happened if I'd done OLCI instead (and let's imagine for the purposes of this post that I didn't have any luggage to check-in). I was flying United Airlines, YQB-EWR-TXL. When we arrived for check-in at the airport (3 hours in advance as any good international traveler should) we found out at the check-in counter that our YQB-EWR flight was delayed by about 5 hours, which would consequently make us miss our EWR-TXL flight. The check-in agent then proceeded to book us on other flights to get us to TXL. (For the record, I've already posted my happy review of United for this, contrary to all the angry rants against United: tripadvisor.ca/ShowTopic-g1-i10702-k5774161-… ) Now, if I had done OLCI, didn't have any luggage to check-in, what do you suppose would've happened? I would've gone through security, and proceeded to my gate, without any knowledge of the delay (again, assuming I didn't look at any of the departure screens before security). When/how would this have been addressed, then? Maybe then I would've experienced that infamous ""horrible"" service from UA? Any insights from you expert travelers who always use OLCI? I'm not saying OLCI is bad, I've just never used it (yet) and I'm wondering what would happen in such situations.

Today I want to do the booking for the month of Sep using this amount but another AIR ASIA POLICY is that I can not do Flight+HOTEL booking using this amount. I can do only flight booking with this amount. WHY AIR ASIA FORGETTING “THIS IS MY MONEY”. 3. Call center executive told me to do flight booking using this amount, Bangkok return flight will cost approx 200 SGD max , what will I do with remaining 139SGD? I can not do hotel booking either. 4. If I am doing separate booking that will cost me more. And not even that I can not use this 139SGD for that. 5. CALL Center executive even suggested to wait till fares go up and use this amount then and end up paying MORE , WHAT a Disgusting suggesting and to make customer fool 6. Air ASIA can not do refund for the remaining balance amount of 139SGD to my account as per their policy and cant use the amount for hotel booking 7. I have not received my hotel booking cancellation amount till now in my credit card. This is clear case of CHEATING BY AIR ASIA and Playing with customer money. These are the behaviors just to ensure I will not travel by air asia in future and same applies to my near and dear and collegues..",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,1,2089,"I've been shopping around on Skyscanner a long-haul flight, and as many of you may know, the price can differ dramatically depending on which country you leave from. I'm in the UK, but I was open to taking a low-cost flight to a third country if it worked out cheaper. The best flight I found starts in a third country, but then goes *via* the UK. I looked up just the portion of the trip starting in the UK, and it was almost a third more expensive again. So I thought– what if I just booked the whole trip, but just show up at the UK airport, and start with the 'second' leg? Each leg is with a different airline– the long-haul flight is wih Virgin, and the connecting third-country flights are with BA. I checked the T&C on the ticketing website (not an airline), and it says that you must use tickets consecutively, and missing one leg means subsequent legs will be cancelled. However, as far as I can see, BA and Virgin don't codeshare, and it's hard to see how Virgin would know if I didn't get on my BA flight a few hours earlier. Am I being naïve, or could I do this? I know it doesn't seem quite legit, but seems like everyone wins– I get my cheap long haul, the ticket company and airlines get their money, and BA gets a lighter flight than they planned for (or the overbooked passengers get a seat). On the other hand, it's a very important trip, and I don't want to risk losing it. Any clarity/certainty would be appreciated– especially from someone who may have done this before.

1,1,2083,"My husband and I are flying Wizz Air from Madrid to Budapest with our 23 month old daughter in just a few short weeks. We have read the carry-on luggage information on the website but were wondering how exact they were with the dimensions of the carry-on baggage. We are fairly certain that we can keep it under the maximum weight but one or two of the dimensions might be a cm or so more than the allowance if it is packed too full. Will someone take out a tape measure and actually measure the dimensions or as long as it looks to be the right size, will we be alright? What we have is probably the maximum dimensions for the typical transatlantic flights from the US via one of the bigger airlines (US Airways, American, Delta, etc.). We really don't want to have to buy two more carryon luggage pieces for a couple of cms, but we don't want to run into a problem, either. For what it's worth, we have taken this carry-on luggage with us on every other trip we've ever taken overseas and have carried it on both Ryanair and Easyjet flights. (Ryanair lists the same dimension requirements as Wizz Air.) I was just curious as to how exact they are about things or if they will just estimate by sight. If we get to the airport and discover there is a problem with the size, will they tell us when we check our other baggage? Or will we at least know when we go through security? What I don't want to happen is for us to get all the way to the gate and then have them say that our luggage isn't the right size and then have to figure out what to do about it.

1,1,2225,"Hello Everyone! I’m hoping for a bit of advice with regard to refundable vs. non-refundable flights, and how travel insurance might factor in the decision. I am shopping for fares to book a roundtrip ticket for a trip in which I’m planning to be away for about three months this summer. The exact date of my early August departure (or November return for that matter) isn’t terribly sensitive, and as I don’t forsee any scheduling issues this far in advance, I’ll likely select travel dates on which I can find the best rates. But as I’ve got just a tinge of worry that something important might arise forcing me to change (or even worse cancel) my trip unexpectedly, I have been comparing refundable fares as well. I’m astonished at the difference! A basic non-refundable fare from Baltimore/Washington area airports to CDG is in the area of 1,200 to 1,400 US. Compare that to the refundable fares, with the same dates and carriers, at around 3,300 – 3,500 US!! Is such a drastic increase usual? I was expecting a few/several hundred diff., but 2.5x the cost seems abnormal! Now I should also note that in addition to my flight arrangements, I’ve also been researching travel insurance policies, just for a bit of added peace of mind I suppose. I’ve been told that a number of such policies extend to cover flight cancellations, which I understood to mean that one would be covered in the event of an airline caused cancellation. Can anyone confirm to what degree such policies could cover me in case of having to cancel or postpone my trip? Are there any particularly good agencies people have used and would recommend (or urge to avoid!)? Would this be a good alternative to splashing out on that oh-so-expensive refundable airfare?? Thanks for reading, and I'll look forward to your suggestions! Best",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

It's likely that I'm about (i.e. first trip will be befroe the end of March) to embark on LHR <-> GRU once a month for 7 months ish (2 weeks in each destination) and I'm trying to work out which combinations of airlines and routes might be best for me, I'd appreciate opinions on the routes and FF programmes. I am restrictred slightly by the forced usage of certain airlines/routes by my company and I can't book that far in advance (maybe 2 trips/months in advance) due to changing requirements. Key details: - Economy always ( damn you corporate policy! ) typically discount economy fares - I only hold a British passport (no restrictions - i.e. I can transit the US etc) - I have 90 tier points with BA at the moment. Membership year ends of March - No other FF memberships of note (i.e. I have them but 0 balances) My choices basically amount to the following combos which I can't necessarily always book due to the particular airline not being the cheapest those dates (i.e. I can't always consistently stick with one). The corporate booking agent have various rules to list options as ""valid"" or not: 1) AA via JFK (generally only a ""valid"" option at short notice) 2) IB via MAD 3) LH via FRA or MUC 4) TAM direct 5) BA direct (very very rare that this is cheap enough to be considered - generally only cheap enough over the world cup, go figure) 6) KLM/AF via AMS/CDG (typically out one way, back the other) and an occaisional smattering of others (DL via JFK, TAP via LIS, etc). I'm tempted to stick with OneWorld carriers as for shorthaul often my company will fly us BA and so I'd like to use this to try to get lounge access - but my BAEC account will rollover to a new membership year before I reach silver and except going consistently via JFK I'm not sure I'll get enough miles/points/etc to make the cut with other programmes. Irritatingly TAM only switch to OneWorld at the end of March and there's no word (as far as I can see) as to what they plan to do FF programme wise. Any opinions from the regulars or just do whatever the hell I can on the fly given the confusing situation? Also any tips from anyone in negotiating business class travel from their employer when there's a blanket economy policy even for long haul?",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

While the sales for travel during that time haven't been posted, I'm curious from all you TA people out there which of these options would you seriously consider. Of course, fare will be part of the decision but if all fares are equal or close, then considering the plane and seat configuration plays a big role. At this point I will be in economy, although if there's a decent fare for premium econ, I may consider that. American - via Mia, flies 767s with 2-3-2 seating. I am an Advantage member and would earn miles. Air France, via Atlanta, JFK, IAD or Detroit. Flies 777-200s, A340s or the A380. I have flown AF in the past and enjoy their service. Seating is either 2-4-2 or 3-4-3. Aer LIngus from Orlando to Dublin, then connecting to Paris. Flies A-330's, with 2-4-2 seating. US Air via CLT or PHI, in A-330s with 2-4-2 seating. Lufthansa from Orlando to FRA then connecting to Paris. Flies 747 with 3-4-3 seating. I'm interested in views re: service on the flights and seating configuration. If you were flying by yourself, would you prefer the 2-3 -2 or the 2-4-2 or the 3-4-3 configuration. I typically try for a window seat so I can sleep better but will also take an aisle on the center section if I think there's a great chance of an empty seat next to me. What about the window sections with 3 seats -- would that middle seat be the last to be assigned (unless of course a couple requests it).

1,1,2154,I am by nature a cautious person........ If I book a United domestic and international ticket (US to AUS) on webjet.com will I be able to go into United.com and select my seats thru the usual method - ie log in with either itinerary or mileage plus # and choose either regular economy or purchase E+ seat? Which then leads me to Q2 - Can I link my mileage plus number to the webjet booked ticket? (the fares i have found are about $140 cheaper thru webjet as opposed to United.com so I am very tempted - that's almost the price of E+ on one trans pacific leg) Thank you,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1

We are going to Europe this summer - family of 4 - but a parent is in poor health. Been in poor health for years so nothing new. If something terrible happens and parent dies here in US while we are in vacation in Europe, I will want to come home. My assumption is that we will all come home.

1,1,1488,"American Airlines Welcomes All Thieves Aboard! During my recent overnight AA flight 192 from Los Angeles to Boston, a brazen passenger rummaged through overhead bins, removed my luggage and stole both my Apple iPad and iPhone. Since I installed Apple’s Mobile Me software with the location finder, I was able to determine the culprit’s street address in South Boston as soon as each device was turned on. While Google maps showed me that the address was a three-story apartment building, the location finder could not tell me the specific unit number. I contacted Boston Police to report the crime, and they asked me to obtain the passengers name so they could investigate the theft. I then contacted American’s customer relations department and they informed me that “they could only release the passenger’s name if the police issued a subpoena.” Ever hear of Catch 22? How can the police issue a subpoena without a name? Customer relations also said their policy doesn't cover any losses from onboard theft, regardless of circumstances. I then contacted American’s press relations department. They informed me that “overhead bins are public storage spaces to which customers have free access. As with any public place, it is each individual’s personal responsibility to ensure the security of their belongings. We cannot be held responsible for any unattended items reported missing.” If I'm on an overnight flight, shouldn't I be sleeping instead of guarding ""my"" shared overhead bin? Don't you think American has a responsibility to inform passengers of this – or at least issue some legal disclaimer – during pre-flight instructions? “Dear passengers, anyone can access your valuables while you are asleep during flight and we will not question them, or be held responsible. Please keep valuables in your possession at all times, or avoid sleeping on overnight flights.” That would be reassuring, don't you think? It’s very disturbing and hypocritical that American will offer me a $400 voucher if they overbook a flight, and will cover lost baggage up to $3,300, but they will offer no compensation whatsoever for theft that occurred under their watch while I was sleeping on an overnight flight. Perhaps just as bad, they will not even help me recoup my property, despite me having proof of a person’s whereabouts. This is a warning that none of your valuables are safe on American, and they will assume no responsibility regardless of circumstances. I’m sure thieves know this, too. And it’s probably safe to say that until American does something about it, others will fall prey to the same pilfering. That’s my experience and perspective.

Then I started reading the forums on Air India experiences....oh dear... If it wasn't for the £125 per person fee, I'd cancel and rebook with Emirates. Anyone got anything reassuring to say about recent experiences on that route? My biggest worry is frankly having to entertain two children for a long-haul flight if the in-flight entertainment doesn't work! I also see that they're switching the route after Christmas from a 787 to a 777-300ER...any way I can find out how old and broken down my plane is likely to be?

The trip will be approximately 1 month in length and we will be visiting many cities - Aomori, Sendai, Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe etc. At the moment we have a plan in place and are thinking about booking hotels and flights. It was suggested to us by a friend that we could potentially get a travel agent to book hotels and flights for a cheaper price. After a search on the internet, the search engines on travel agency sort of websites are usually for stays at only one place (so one hotel). Locally in Melbourne, it seems that Flight Centre doesn't provide very good service after seeing a few reviews. So we are wondering whether it is better to just book hotels separately on sites like expedia? If yes, there are so many websites, so can you guys please suggest your recommendation? Or even which site not to use with a reason. One other thing, we would like rooms with 3 separate beds for 3 people. Are they rare or difficult to book?

1,2,6687,"Our family of 5 went on vacation from Dallas to Fort Lauderdale during the last week of July 2012. I seriously considered driving to save on money. But that would be over 24 hours in the van with 3 young kids, not counting all the stops we would have to make in between. So, I decided to give Spirit a try. I had heard all the horror stories about them, so my expectation wasn't very high. All I wanted was to get on a plane at DFW and get to Florida in one piece the same day instead of 24hrs. *****Customer Service issue 1. I purchased 5 tickets, and the next day I was reviewing my purchase and to my horror I noticed my first mistake. I accidentally purchased 5 carry on bags instead of 5 check in baggage. Spirit is pretty strict with their refund policy. But I decided to call anyways. customer service was polite but reluctant. Eventually they gave me a full refund on the carry on which I used to purchased 5 check in bags. *****Customer Service issue 2. I elected not to pre-purchase seating. I was afraid that we would be spread out and not be seated together. So I wanted to check in online early right at 24hrs before the flight so we could at least be seated as a group. 24 hours came and I went online to check in but the link wasn't there. I called customer service and they told me that since I'm traveling with kids, I could not do online check in, I had to do counter check in at the airport. Again they were polite but in this case gave me the wrong info. The day of travel I looked online and the link was there, but I took their advice and waited till I got to the airport. *****Traveling Day. I wanted to be at the airport 3 hours early but things didn't go as planned. We ended up getting to the check out counter right at 5PM and our flight was for 6:45PM. They quickly checked us in and to our surprise we were all seated together 9ABCDE. We were able to quickly get thru security and we boarded and took off on time. The plane wasn't new but everything was clean and we had reclining seats. Something was rattling quite loudly during our takeoff from DFW. But once in the air it was smooth sailing all the way to FLL. The cabin crew was courteous but don't expect any frills. You have to purchase beverages or snacks if you want them Credit Card only no Cash. A can of soda is $3 and a bag of pretzel is $6. If you want something to drink or eat I recommend buying it before boarding. That's what we did. *****Return Trip. We got to the airport at 4PM for an 8:25 flight. Plenty of time. At FLL we didn't see any human check in counter for domestic travel. We had to use an automated check in counter. They have lots of them at FLL. I'm guessing at least 20. They have a customer service agent assigned for a set number of machines. She was very friendly and actually did it for us. the machine automatically spits out 5 boarding passes together. 17ABCDE. The plane was a brand new Airbus A320. Very comfortable seats, but they don't recline and they are close together. The flight was smooth and uneventful which is a good thing. Smooth sailing for 2 1/2 hours until we landed. We took off on time. *****Rating. All in all I would have to give Spirit an A. Given my expectation everything went as well as the big boys. So no complaints from me. I would definitely fly them again. *****Advice. -If flying as a family in our case 5, in pays to purchase the $9 fare club. It saved us a lot on luggage. -Spirit has more rules than most airlines, so make sure you know what you're getting into. Use their rules to your advantage and you can save big on the price of a ticket. -I'm short 5'8 so that wasn't a problem for me, but if you're a really tall person, or hefty you may want to pay extra for the big seats upfront. -Last but not least give yourself plenty of time for this airline.

1,2,6974,"Hi My husband and I are off to the States next August. The ONLY thing that is non-negotiable is that we have to be in Salt Lake City on day X for a 7 night coach tour, returning to Salt Lake City for the flight home to the UK. And we may decide to stay an extra day SLC before flying home. Just because we can, we'd like also to spend a week beforehand in Las Vegas (Grand Canyon etc). And just because, well, why not, we are also considering a few days that would mean flying into Cincinnati to see a couple of things that are of interest. This part we can ditch if it's too difficult to plan / bumps the price up too much. It's just a 'nice to do if poss'. And no, I don't plan on going back to the States after this, since my holiday wish list already covers the next 10 years! But anyway... 1. I have an assumption in my head that it would be cheaper to fly from the UK to the same US city that we would fly home to rather than open-jaw / multi city. Am I right in thinking this? 2. Based on the above assumption, that it would then be cheaper for me to sort out the internal flights separately as I would then have more choice of airlines incl. the domestic airlines 3. There are too many combinations and it's doing my head in! eg Fly to SLC and from there to LAS to CVG to SLC or...SLC / CVG / LAS / SLC or.... fly from uk to LAS / CVG / SLC or ...hmm, I don't think I want to do UK to CVG as there are no direct flights, I believe. 4. I'm beginning to think LAS / CVG / SLC ( but is it then better to fly back to LAS for the return to the UK, or is the price difference not that great if I fly into one and out from another?) 5. If you have the slightest notion of what I'm going on about, I salute you, and thank you for any thoughts you may have that would help clarify things for me. I think it's just that because outside of the specific coach tour, we have no fixed plans, no fixed timescales and can go here, there and everywhere! I would like to go premium economy (or whisper it; if a sale comes up and we can find a business fare...! I only care about that UK to USA and back again.

It seems like decades since I booked a flight to anywhere except Europe or the USA so I am not up to date. My fellow traveller is pretty much convinced we should get down to the nearest London travel agent or click on South African Airways right away (January), on the grounds that tickets will go up or flights sell out. Then it's done. I reckon it could be worth waiting a bit. Do air fare prices drop significantly? Is it too early to hunt for a better deal, and what are the best search engines and web sites to check? How long should I wait? Secondly, any advice on internal flights or other transport from Cape Town to Jo'burg? We plan a few days in CT and then go on to Kruger National Park. There is no way, incidentally, that we are going to wait until the last minute and hope for a cut price deal a week before departure. No way. Absolutely no way no matter how much cheaper.

It took ages for them to pick up the phone and they kept quoting the new price but as soon as I agreed then they would pass me on to another person or cut the phone. I am not sure what trick they are playing but it sure is a trick. So after someone at Ebookers call centre finally picks up the phone, they take ages to understand what you are saying and in the guise of trying to get you good ticket prices as 'the system is live', once you agree to a price then they pass you to the booking department, where once again someone starts the whole process. I did this rigmarole with 3 people and as it was costing me a lot on my mobile I thought I would try on Chat on their website - surprisingly they managed to do the same scam over chat too. As I was very frustrated I droppedtge chat. So when things go wrong, Ebookers are lousy. Also it is not easy to understand the accent of the call centre operators.

1,2,6551,"We are frequent travelers, but use low cost airlines only occasionally. 2 weeks ago we set about to send our kids to Spain with Vueling. A big mistake. To start with, they are low cost only selectively, basically on routes where there is meaningful competition. To Malaga for example, the price per ticket is €350, not exactly low cost, and not so different from what 'classic' airlines charge. Now to service: The flight to Malaga was delayed 4hr 58 min, basically 2 minutes less than the limit according to European regulation, that would require a ticket refund. Maybe a coincidence? I don't think so.. For a variety of reasons we de decided to no longer fly to Malaga because of the delay. We asked for the refund from their 'customer service'. We were told that the 2min less than 5hrs meant they owed us nothing. We appealed, they ignored our communication. We asked to speak to a manager, we were never referred to one. We wrote to the CEO Alex Cruz, he never replied. We will now write to the chairman of the holding company. Being 'low cost' doesn't mean you can treat customers like crap.

Didnt make it. We were stranded. Noone was answering the phone. Tough luck. Hotel at our expense. The cheap flight was beginnning to cost us against other airlines who take responsibility for you. - We booked through expedia. Went to check in. We werent sitting together. $30 to sit together. This isnt low cost its hidden cost. - We specified my wifes vegetarian preference when booking. We thought that meant food. We were wrong. - You have to preorder food. For a nine hour flight do you have any choice? This isnt low cost its hidden cost. They dont allow you to bring food or drink on board - What is worse they serve the food as soon as you take off. On the return journey I asked for my breakfast to be served before we got into sydney. Sure they said. When it arrived it had been in the warmer all night. Inedible. Baked beans dry and crusted. - The woman next to us started throwing up. The staff avoided coming anywhere near us instead of offering help. - On one leg they started aggressively selling thier onboard merchandise. He may as well have had a megaphone. Awful experience. Multiple sales pitches. - In KL they use an old airline building where the toilets are either squat or have a pipe coming out of the cistern (close the lid before flushing) - Departing from KL we were herded into a holding room for an hour. You have to sit on the floor as there just arent the seats. Recommendations- - dont take a last flight out of anywhere as every flight we took was late - dont fly more than 4 hours. You wont eat. - look carefully at the price. Compare them against airlines who will take care of you if you get stranded and dont spring extra charges.

We recently took the whole family (12 persons!) from Tel Aviv to Florence via Rome. Did you know that Alitalia does not allow any preseating until 20 hours prior to flight? And on top of that they usually do not allow the preseating of children. What does Alitalia expect parents to do? Hand the children to sit near strangers? Once I got in Alitalia's site 20 hour before departue, this was the most user unfriendly site. It kept getting stuck. When I finally got the plane's seating map it came on without the seats!!! It would only accept one passenger at a time although they were on the same code number. It took me 3 hours! Thank you, Alitalia, for being so far behind all other airlines. You are really unique in your lack of efficiency! And if that is not enough - then we had the most frightening landing in Florence. The plane came down in such a bang that all passengers were shocked. One of my family member is a commercial pilot. She was sitting next to me and said that she would have been fired on the spot for such a landing! But then we had to fly back to Israel.

We *know* we will have to create a fake ticket to get an upgrade for our departure, as we can't book our real return (end of March) until *those* dates open on the calendar. We *know* we will have to pay $200 pp on a ticket change when we book the return. We *know* we will have to pay $350 just to use our miles for upgrades. It's still cheaper than buying first class tickets outright. What is most frustrating is that there is no way to find a flight with two upgrade-able seats without calling AA -- and waiting through three minutes of canned drivel before we find a representative and go through the whole 'wanna' list with her. This is a complete waste of AA's time as well as ours. IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO DO THIS? (We realize we are fortunate to be able to travel to Maui.

1,2,7495,"I've tried to look around for an answer, but figured asking directly is the easiest. Here is the dilemma: My friend and I are planning a trip together for June. We will be visiting Paris for a few days, with a day stopover in Dubai, then taking a safari in Kenya. He is currently working in the middle east and will be coming to the US to visit first, then flying to Paris from New York. His company is paying for his flight from New York to Paris, then Paris to Dubai. These flights have already been booked. I will be traveling from Florida, hopefully linking up with him in New York to fly together to Paris, then we will fly together to Dubai. The flights from Dubai to Nairobi, then Nairobi back home, are not supplied by his company, so we figured we could book those together online. The question I have is -- how do I create an itinerary from Florida to New York to Paris to Dubai, making sure I end up on the same flights as him for the NY, Paris, and Dubai legs? I have tried to look online for the same flights but nothing is letting me specify certain flights for certain legs and link them all into one itinerary, without purchasing a bunch of one-way single tickets, which I imagine would be a nightmare as a far as checking bags, getting boarding passes, etc. Am I going to have to use a travel agent to book these all together? And how can I link up with my friend's itinerary so that if a flight is changed or cancelled, we will both be rerouted to the same place? I am sure this is a simple thing and I am just over thinking; I have had plenty of experience flying domestically and buying tickets online, but not internationally and not when booking tickets separately.

1,2,6543,"This week I made a day trip on Air Berlin from (London) Stansted to Nuremberg, as I have done several times before. Indeed I have travelled through STN many times on different airlines. Not my favourite, but good enough. Anyway, this trip, I parked in the red short stay, furthest away from the terminal. I don't mind walking the extra 100 yds and I loathe driving round looking for a space. This is where I usually park. On my return to STN, I paid for the car park in the baggage hall. I usually do this if available - it saves queuing later, or finding that the machines are broken, again. Time on my receipt, 19:06. I went straight to my car. Not running, but not crawling either. changed my shoes & jacket. I started the engine. I waited for the screen to clear. I set off. A routine I have followed many times. I got to the barrier, fed it with my ticket, and waited. And waited. AND WAITED. So I looked at the display, which boldly told me that a payment of £2.50 was due. At this point, seeting and desperate to escape, I used the pay at barrier facility, which was miraculously working. Time on receipt: 19:28. Now I don't think 22 minutes is unreasonable to take to find the car and get to the barrier. I have taken far longer on occassion when I have forgotten where I have parked. So what is going on STN? This behaviour is either a mistake or an intentional revenue stream. Either way, it is unacceptable, and I thought I should share it with the World before I take it up with you because I have had it up to here with poor service and I want everyone to know that you have found a hithertoo unknown way in which to suck.

We're looking at travelling to New Zealand in April 2013 and had initially thought of going via LAX and booking the Sky Couch. However, I’ve read a lot of horror stories about the transit experience in LA so from that perspective would prefer to go via Hong Kong – obviously no Sky Couch that way, so Premium Economy enters the mix. Having had a hellish experience flying in Cathay Pacific’s economy spaceseats we are very keen to avoid Air NZ’s new Premium Economy, but I think I’m right in saying that the planes on the HK route still have the old version? Questions is Sky Couch good enough to override the poor transfer experience at LAX? (My husband is 6’1” and very broad in the shoulders, if that makes any difference) how much does it actually cost? (Economy for 2 on the desired flights would be about £2,700) given the choice, would you go for Sky Couch or old-style Premium Economy? is there any danger the new fleet will be rolled out to the HK route in the next 10 months, leaving us stuck with spaceseats?

I'm travelling to Malaysia with Malaysian airlines in May from LHR on a 12 hour flight. I suffer quite badly from irritable bowl syndrome. I've flown a lot as we love to travel and in general not had many problems, mainly because i've taken medication in advance to help calm/stop any symptoms before they start! However, on a flight to Thailand in December last year I was quite ill, I think it was possibly something I'd eaten and unfortunately was stuck on a 6 hour flight with an upset stomach. Thankfully, I was able to get to the bathrooms ok, but was a bit panicked when the seat belt sign went on. Ever since then i've been suffering with anxiety relating to travel, even car travel. We went to Reykjavik over new years and i almost didn't get on the plane as I'd got so anxious it set off my IBS and I was being ill. Eventually I calmed down and was ok for the rest of the flight. My counsellor has suggested looking into whether i can specify seats near the toilets, and also looking into how airlines deal with waste on board so in the worst case scenario I'd be prepared and can plan for this, which would hopefully would make me a little more calm getting on the plane as I'd could reassure myself. Does anyone know where i'd contact to discuss such request and having my seat nearer the toilets? I've looked on malaysian airlines website and there is a contact number but it seems to be in Malaysia. Do I contact this number or the staff at LHR at the malaysian desk there?

I'm having problem to understand the entering/exiting USA through the Visa Waiver Program in my specific case (I read a lot of topic here, all the USA official website, wrote to embassies... but still is not clear to me). So i try to post here for some suggestions. I already have a flight to Canada, where i'll stay 15-30 days. Then my intention is to get to USA under Visa Waiver Program *by land border* (not requiring ESTA > http://goo.gl/THCxbx), spending 45-60 days there. Then moving again *by land border* to Mexico, spending there some more days (still unknown) Once in Mexico i'll decide if to fly back to Italy or to go more south (like Brazil) and from there flying back to Italy. So at the moment i've no booked ticket except the arrival in Canada, and for me the best would be booking my next flights once in Mexico, since i'll decide there what to do next and when. According to the US law entering *by land* the onward/return ticket is not required > http://goo.gl/irXoFR But I have the doubt that also if the onward/return ticket is not a requirement, I think having that could represent for the the Border Officer a strong clue of my intention of NOT remaining illegally in USA (that is anyway not my real intention). So I'm in trouble if considering more the ""written law"" (i don't need a onward ticket entering by land) or considering more the crucial opinion of the Border Officer that could perceive me as a ""potential cheater"" by the clues he could get from interviewing me (""Do you have a job/a boss waiting for you in Italy?"" Me: ""No, i'm on sabbatic"" - ""Do you have a wife/partner/child waiting for you in Italy?"" Me: ""No, I'm single"" - ""Do you have a precise itinerary and onward/return ticket?"" Me: ""No, I'll decide once in Mexico"" - ""Seems you don't have strong ties to Italy neither a onward/return ticket... go back, you could be a cheater wanting to stay illegally in USA""). Since I'm not a lier, I cannot modify my first 2 answer, So I want to understand if would be safer to buy a onward/return flight corresponding to the most probable itinerary I can guess now I'll want to do or I can trust the law that says is not needed. And eventually which onward/return ticket would be enough: - USA to Mexico (by bus) - Mexico to Belize or Guatemala - Mexico to Italy (eventually open) Any suggestions, experiences are welcome!

Are these 'one stop' flights ex Manila likely to be reasonably successful (depending on price) or do Filipinos, Australians and others mostly prefer travelling via Singapore, Hong Kong or Sydney on one stop or direct flights to Australia? Is the need of the Airbus to stop in Darwin a disincentive to use it, notwithstanding that with a competitor such as Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific one has to change planes ex Manila in Singapore or Hong Kong directly, sometimes with reasonably long connections?

The flight dublin-london is with a different airline to that from london-new york. I am now, more than likely, not going to need the dublin-london flight. I know that usually, if you were not to take the first leg of a flight, the airline would cancel the remaining flights. However, as mentioned, the two airlines are different, I'm just not sure whether they will liase with each other and my london-new york flight will be cancelled?!

We are currently exploring options to get from New Orleans to Philadelphia on 01 Jan 2017 and flights are very expensive for obvious reasons. There are only a few direct flights and they are ridiculously pricey. There are indirect flights via different destinations but they are still pricey. I figured we could look for a cheap flight to Washington and then hop on a bus or get a family friend to collect us from there instead. However, when I did this, I have found a VERY well priced flight to Washington ($240), indirect, but VIA PHL?! So confusing. Flights to PHL are double/triple the price than if you book Washington via PHL. What I wanted to know, is if I book these flights, can we simply just hop out at PHL and miss the onward connection?

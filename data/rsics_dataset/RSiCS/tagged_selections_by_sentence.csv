I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway. To sum up, Qantas",0,1,0,1,0,0,0

[We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that! When we got onto the Gold Coast-Auckland leg of our return flight we discovered we had exit row seats and then when the food trolley came round, the hostess informed us we each had $10 voucher for food. This was our first time flying long haul with a LCC.

I paid about $100 extra for an exit row seat (28J) and couldn't recommend this more. The seat is located in the first row in Economy, right behind Club World. After takeoff, they close the curtain and due to there being no toilets here, there's no one walking around to disturb you. My seat was right beside the door which kind of protrudes out. This was used as my leg rest for the entire duration of the flight. If you can't afford Premium Economy, this is a really great option. Dinner was a choice of pasta (with feta and tomatoes) or chicken (with rice and veggies). I had the pasta which was actually quite tasty - by no means a five star meal, but not bad for plane food. The chocolate dessert was delicious. After dinner service, lights went out and it was time to sleep. A word of warning - it's extremely cold by the exits. I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment.

However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under.

When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my ""ok"" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told ""Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday"". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me ""You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway"". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again..

When I called a few wks ago to pay of £590 I was informed that the airfare taxes had risen by £20pp. At the time of booking the agent who booked the holiday said it was possible that they would rise once before the o/b was paid off but not by much. I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't been called/emailed and informed of this, and that it was casually mentioned at the time of payment but I accepted it s I was told they need my ""ok"" before they could deduct the £590 off my card. I asked at least 3 times if the taxes would rise again and was told no repeatedly. All was fine and with the new £20pp tax fee ...my outstanding balance now stood at £64.90 and my friend's was £54.90. I called today (the last day to pay off the booking) to pay the final £119.80 and am told ""Oh it's £150 you owe madam and if it's not paid today you will lose the holiday"". I've had the worst week imaginable and completely lost my cool as I found it incredibly cheeky that they appeared to have plucked this sum out of the air as I had had my o/b confirmed to me repeatedly during the last phone call 3 weeks ago!! I disputed the o/b and went through the maths with the woman on the phone who couldn't understand what I was saying and was in a bloody call centre in India and who said that she'd escalate my complaint to a manager who'd call tomorrow...cue more ranting from me that today was the last day to pay the o/b and that a phone call tomorrow would be useless if she was saying that I'd lose the holiday if it wasn't paid off today. I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me ""You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway"". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional £30 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however ""keep calm"" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just ""dumping"" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger ""dumped"" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference.

I spent forever obsessing about my hand luggage and in the end opted to take only a rucksack – was only staying 3 nights.

In fact, as far as I could see no one on either of our flights had their bags checked. I did wonder though if this was because of flight was running late because as we were queuing to board we could see people departing the plane. Funnily enough we taxied right on time and for the return flight we left about 10 minutes late. I spent ages entering the online check in details as there’s a charge for entering information incorrectly. Again, I needn’t have bothered as the guy barely glanced my passport as he tore my boarding pass.

My question is this:] When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application ""trip cost.""[ Using BA Avios points for a Business Class ticket, the taxes and fees which I paid were about $1100. (OUCH !!!) The first agent told me to insure the cost of the actual ticket. (I knew this wasn't correct so I called back.) The second agent told me I could only list the cost to re-deposit the points in case of cancellation. This would be $65 USD. I wanted to double-check, so I called back a 3rd time, and the 3rd agent told me to put down the cost of the taxes and fees. In case of cancellation, I would get the taxes and fees back from BA. YIKES....I don't know what to do now? ]Does anyone know for sure?[ How do I avoid future trouble about this??? Thanks.]"," When buying the policy, you have to put down on the application ""trip cost.""Does anyone know for sure?","I like to fill out the application for travel insurance correctly so that if I should need it in case of emergency, the insurance company can't claim that my application was invalid because I did it wrong.

1,2,7224,2,"[Here is the description of my terrible experience with FlightNetwork: I needed to book round trip tickets to Copenhagen for 3 people. We searched Google flights for the best deal and found a round trip flight for $843 from Flight Network. Since we needed to book using 3 different credit cards, I called FlightNetwork for the booking to ensure that we all get the same price and availability. First, it takes the agent forever to find the flight I am talking about (even using the flight numbers). Then, the agent tells me that the price I am seeing is due to a “glitch” in the system but they would honour this price. I am put on hold for long periods of time in order for the agent to come to this conclusion. It is already 30 minutes that I’m on the call and I have no new information other than the information I already had accessed online in less than 2 minutes. I tell the agent I would like to book with 3 credit cards and apply a promo code (for $20 discount per booking). The agent then asks me for the credit card numbers. Without asking me for my promo code, she has already applied a random promo code that gives $10 discount. I was frustrated at the incompetence of the agent and the long wait times so I decided I would continue the transaction online. I hang up with the agent, go through the online booking system, put in my credit card, click on “Purchase Now”, only to get a pop up that says the online system could not confirm my fare. I refresh the page and suddenly the flight is showing up at $896. I call back 5 minutes after I’ve hung up with the agent the first time, and she tells me that flight prices have gone up. I now decide to proceed with the booking anyway as it is urgent enough for me to book this flight. Another 45 minutes goes by, again long hold times, and my 3 flights are now booked. I receive emails with details of the booking but no invoice. I told myself I would call the next day to ask about the invoice. The next day, I notice the flight is showing at $843 again! And, on top of that, when I log in to the Air Canada website to manage my booking, the purchase price is actually at $843. So when I call back FlightNetwork, I tell them about this and I also tell them that I can’t even confirm what has been charged because I never received an invoice. Again, more ridiculously long hold times - every time, I ask a question, the agent tells me to hold on, puts me on hold for 5-10 minutes and comes back throwing up an answer she received from someone else. What is the point of customer care agents when they have to consult every question. Initially, the agent tells me that she says I was charged $843 mistakenly. I am so confused. Then, she comes back and says oh no, it was $896 that you were charged. Complete chaos!! She sends me the invoice which says that I am paying $285 for the flight and $611.57 in taxes totalling $896.57. Then I tell her that the flight is back to $843 on their website. She says she cannot see this price in their database. I am literally refreshing the page as I speak to the agent and am seeing $843. I had to send a screenshot of what I am seeing on their website to them to prove that I am seeing this price!! She then says that because the flight is book, she cannot refund the difference but can provide it as a credit due to their price drop protection. I was not satisfied with this but looked like I didn’t have another option so I agree and she tells me that it will appear in my account within 3-5 business days. It has been 4 and still nothing but we will see. During the call, I ask to speak with a supervisor and she tells me that the supervisor will basically tell me the same thing… The total time for this call was 1 hour. Then I finally see the charge on my credit card - I see 2 charges. One with the description AIR CANADA totalling $843 and another with description TASF totalling $53. I google TASF and find out this mean travel agent service fee. I am so furious now as they never informed me that this was part of the price they quoted to me!! It is not even detailed in the invoice. I tried calling and the agent tells me that this doesn’t need to be detailed to me, it is part of the total price but I am still not convinced. This is only $53 but the principle of the matter, I was not informed of the details of the charges to my credit card, let alone the absolutely horrible service, I am sure this is in violation of some consumer protection act or travel agents act. ]Overall absolutely terrible terrible nightmarish experience with FlightNetwork.

Apparently this has been going on frequently, yesterday the flight got to Minn too late to make the connection. If we had been warned earlier in the day, we could have driven to MSP in 4 hours and made the connection. All NW would offer by phone was a late Thurs flight to Detroit that got into LGW on Friday far too late for us. This suggestion also made it clear that NW wasn't going to guarantee we would be able to get to MSP Thursday eiher. Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines.

Luckily we listened to the business travelers in line and did not trust the info given by phone, so we stayed in line and the in-person clerk (who was also helping unload planes at the same time) was able to reroute us to get to LGW three hours earlier which gives us a good shot at making the services. It may take all of Thursday to get to Gatwick but at least it's a chance if it all goes well. To add insult to this, while on hold with NW, they were playing an ad offering bonus miles to fly into Msp!!! If they had any kind of conscience they would be warning potential passengers of the delays and they all should change their schedules to avoid these delays. Oh, but then they might lose business, better to have a captive angry passenger than no passenger at all. I have not flown United for quite a number of years since that summer period when they were also stranding passengers in Denver and Chicago. I'm afraid that I'll be avoiding NW, especially their Airlink, for at least that many years after this. I can't think of any other business that I have been lied to and manipulated by for years and years as much as by the airlines. There was a time when I really did enjoy traveling, but that was before the hubs, maximizing seat capacity, disappearance of snacks and cancelling flights to make sure the other flights have no empty seats.",0,1,0,1,0,0,0

1,2,7456,2,"I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.","I have not flown internationally in a long time....or even domestically since the invention of the TSA. I therefore had some trepidation about the flight, figuring it would be a royal PITA, no food, and generally where the end would justify the means. Wrong. I chose British Airways Open Skies from Newark to Orly because I had always had good experiences with BA. Also, I liked the idea of a smaller plane with less people. It seemed to be a bit more civilized. I was not disappointed even though we traveled economy. The seats were leather and comfy, and not quite as narrow as some. Our seats were the first row in economy, so although not separated by a wall, there was a lot of leg space between our seats and the last row of business class. We were not treated as if we were the inferior class. We received iPads, a full meal which was quite good, as well as a small breakfast snack before landing...all at no additional cost. Upon the return we were two in three seats, which was terrific. We had a sizable snack, a full meal which was also quite good and another snack prior to landing. The flight crew (captain et al) on both flights were terrific....informative and very personable. The flight attendants were very pleasant, professional and helpful...and love the uniforms as they have a chic retro vibe. Along with the pillow and blanket we received a packet with eye shades, socks, and another item I can't recall. Boarding and disembarking were both a breeze although upon Orly arrival we did not have jetway access but had to disembark on the airfield where a bus waited to take us to the terminal. On the return to Newark we hit a wind shear upon touch down which the female pilot handled very admirably. Luggage retrieval was painless...again, due to far fewer passengers. One point...the 757-200 is a narrow body jet. Therefore the aisles are narrower than many other types of aircraft. Therefore, any bump in the air will cause you to bump the passenger in the seat if walking in the aisle, or be bumped if you are seated. Other than that, the flight was like flying used to be, when passengers were treated like humans, and not cattle. IMO, all,others airlines should,take a page out of the BAOS book. I would fly them again in a heartbeat. Now all they need to add is in flight WiFi, and the service would be perfect.",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After waiting for well over two hours after the flight landed, the people representing American Airlines Cargo could not give any information other than ""we don't know where the dog is, there were no dogs on flight 558"".

    "### Approach\n",
    "The task is modelled as a binary topic classification task for sentences/text, where two classes are:\n",
    "0: Ubuntu content sentence\n",
    "1: Phatic sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset modeling for Classification\n",
    "To create the dataset for class 0 (Ubuntu content sentence), all the messages are parsed into sentences, and the sentences \n",
    "of token length 7 or more are collected. Taking the large sentences only increase the probability of having content \n",
    "words in the sentence, while the phatic sentences generally tend to be of smaller length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For class 1 (Phatic sentence), any non Ubuntu(or related) topic conversation / dialogue dataset can be used. The assumption is\n",
    "that any other dialogue data would also contain phatic sentences in addition to the topic related sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, learning a classifier to discriminate between these two classes would essentially be basing its decision on two aspects, 1. Topic of the sentence i.e. Ubuntu or other, 2. The classifier would have only seen the phatic sentences\n",
    "in the class 1 dataset i.e. non Ubuntu topic conversations. \n",
    "\n",
    "A publicly available dataset of travel related customer support (RSiCS - https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/nextit-public/rsics.html),is used to model the class 1 (Phatic sentence) data. For this exercise, \"tagged_selections_by_sentence.csv\" from RSiCS dataset is used, which contains manual annotations for segmenting the dialogue into two key pieces - conveys the intent or not, in addition to further annotations like Greetings, Rant etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "The classifier is evaluated on:\n",
    "1. Validation set: A portion of the dataset created above.\n",
    "2. Test set: Phatic examples as provided in the instructions mixed with some non-phatic sentences. A mock small test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy scores are being used as metric for evaluation."
